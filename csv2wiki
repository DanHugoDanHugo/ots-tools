Convert each row of a UTF-8 or Latin-1 CSV file to a MediaWiki page.

Basic usage:

  $ csv2wiki -c CONFIG_FILE [OPTIONS] (CSV_FILE | --delete-matching=PATTERN)

The common case is to pass a CSV_FILE on the command line; wiki pages
will then be created (or updated) based on the CSV contents.  (For the
less common page-deletion case, see section "Page deletion support".)

The CONFIG_FILE contains the wiki URL, login information, and various
other run-time parameters.  It is in standard .ini file format, with
a sole "[default]" section and the following elements in that section:

  wiki_url:            The url of the wiki, e.g. "http://localhost/mediawiki",
                       "https://www.example.com/mwiki", etc.

  username:            User account with write/create permission in the wiki.
                       (With --delete, user needs page-delete permission.)

  password:            The wiki password corresponding to the username.

  toc_name:            Title for the generated Table of Contents page.

  title_tmpl:          Template into which selected column values from
                       a row are substituted to create the title of
                       each row's page.  Columns are specified with
                       "{N}" in the string, where N is a column number.
                       The special column {0} is the CSV row number,
                       which is automatically left-padded with zeros
                       appropriately for the total number of rows.

                       For example:

                       Suppose title_tmpl is "Entry_{1}_{3}_{0}",
                       column 1 contains "foo", column 3 has "bar",
                       and this is row 15 of a CSV file with 250 rows.
                       The page title corresponding to this row would
                       be "Entry_foo_bar_015".

                       *NOTE:* 

                       The titles generated this way must be unique.
                       Typically, you ensure uniqueness by making sure
                       that at least one element of title_tmpl is some
                       kind of unique identifying number -- either a
                       column whose value is known to be unique, or
                       the row number.

                       If the generated page titles are not unique,
                       only the last row in the set of duplicates will
                       appear in the wiki.  (TODO: we could solve this
                       by checking for collisions and adding a unique
                       tail when one happens, but we currently don't
                       do that.  So, be careful.)

  cat_col:             The number of the column (if any) in the CSV
                       file that should be used to create a category
                       for that row; column numbering begins at 1, not
                       0.  Omit this, or leave the value blank, to not
                       use categories at all.

  keep_empty:          If present, still create sections for empty
                       cells in the CSV.  If a value is provided, use
                       that value as the content of the section;
                       otherwise, use the empty string.

                       In omitted, then simply don't create a section
                       within a row's page for any column (cell) that
                       has no content; this is the default behavior.

  delimiter:           A single-char delimiter used to separate columns
                       in a CSV row.  If omitted, defaults to ','.

  quotechar:           A single-char quotechar used to wrap contents of
                       a single cell in the CSV file.  If omitted, 
                       defaults to '"'.

  path_to_api:         The API path under the URL; defaults to "/"; see
                       mwclient.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/connecting.html.
                       Note that on Wikipedia.org, this would be "/w/", 
                       but in most non-Wikipedia instances of MediaWiki,
                       the default "/" is more likely.  So if you're using
                       that default, you don't have to specify this at all.

Example config file
-------------------

Here is an example config file:

  [default]
  wiki_url: http://localhost/mediawiki
  username: wikibot
  password: bqaRY76gtXu
  title_tmpl: Entry_{1}
  toc_name: List_of_Entries
  cat_col: 5

The "[default]" section name at the top must be present.  The .ini
format always has sections, and for the sake of forward compatibility
this script requires the one section's name to be "default".

Command-line options:
---------------------

In general, the config file is for run-time configuration that is
likely to be permanent (e.g., used for a production run), and
command-line options are for optional behavior that is likely to vary
from run to run.  The exception to this is the "-c" option, of course,
since it's how the config file is indicated in the first place.

  -c | --config FILE   Use FILE as the run-time job control file;
                       see the "Example config file" section above.

  --null-as-value      When a cell's entire content is the word
                       "null" (matched case-insensitively), then treat
                       the cell as having that literal content,
                       instead of treating the cell as being empty.
                       (The latter is the default because in most CSV
                       files, if a cell just contains the word "null",
                       that's just a kind of conversion error and is
                       really an indication that the cell is empty.)

  --pare N             Convert only 1/N of the CSV rows to wiki pages.
                       This is useful for doing test conversions of a
                       large CSV file, when you don't want to convert
                       every row in every run.  The --pare option will
                       convert just 1/N rows, spaced evenly across the
                       CSV file and selected deterministically.

  --delete-matching    See "Page deletion support" section below.

  -h | --help          Show usage message and exit without error.

Page deletion support
---------------------

This script also supports batch deletion of pages, since a possible
outcome of running this is that you end up with pages in your wiki
that you don't want.  Use the "--delete-matching PATTERN" option to
remove them.  All pages whose names match PATTERN will be deleted (and
no pages will be created).

Typically, PATTERN will be similar to the title_tmpl config element,
since --delete-matching is most often used to delete pages originally
created with this script.

   (TODO: Page deletion does not yet de-list the removed pages from
          the generated TOC page.  We should fix that.)

Dependencies and Troubleshooting
--------------------------------

* This requires the 'mwclient' and 'unidecode' Python libraries

  If you get an error that looks something like this:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "./csv2wiki", line 27, in <module>
        from mwclient import Site
    ImportError: No module named mwclient

  or this:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "./csv2wiki", line 27, in <module>
        from unidecode import unidecode
    ImportError: No module named unidecode

  then run these commands

    $ sudo pip install mwclient
    $ sudo pip install unidecode

  and try again.

* You may need to convert carriage returns to linefeeds

  If your CSV input file uses only carriage returns (CR) for line
  breaks, then you must convert it to using line feeds (LF).  On
  Unix-like systems, this should work:

    $ tr '\\r' '\\n' < cr-file.csv > lf-file.csv

  Note this should not be necessary if the CSV file is in CRLF format,
  that is, the Microsoft Windows / MS-DOS standard for line endings,
  which uses both characters together at the end of each line.

* If you run create/delete multiple times, you may need to run
  
    $ php maintenance/rebuildall.php
  
  in your MediaWiki instance to link pages to their categories properly.
  That script takes about 10 minutes to run for a wiki with <300 pages.
  
* If you get errors saving some pages, it may be an anti-spam plugin.
  
  If your MediaWiki instance has Extension:SpamBlacklist enabled,
  then you may get errors when trying to create pages that contain
  certain kinds of URLs or email addresses (namely, URLs or email
  addresses that SpamBlacklist thinks look spammy). 
  
  One solution is to just turn off Extension:SpamBlacklist entirely.
  But even if you don't have that kind of administrative access,
  you might still have enough access to *configure* the extension, 
  in which case you can whitelist everything via a catchall regexp.
  Visit one or of of these pages:
  
    https://mywiki.example.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist
    https://mywiki.example.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Email-whitelist
  
  You'll see a commented-out explanation of how the whitelist works.
  Just add a line with the regular expression ".*", as in this example:
  
    # External URLs matching this list will *not* be blocked even if they would
    # have been blocked by blacklist entries.
    #
    # Syntax is as follows:
    #   * Everything from a "#" character to the end of the line is a comment
    #   * Every non-blank line is a regex fragment which will only match hosts inside URLs
    .*
  
  That will let you save a page containing any URL.  (Things work
  similarly on the Email-whitelist page).
