#
# NOTES: 
#
#  - If you run create/delete multiple times, you may need to run
#
#      $ php maintenance/rebuildall.php
#
#    in your mediawiki instance to link pages to their categories properly.
#    This script takes about 10 minutes to run for a wiki with <300 pages.
#
#  - If you get errors saving some pages, read this:
#
#    If your MediaWiki instance has Extension:SpamBlacklist enabled,
#    then you may get errors when trying to create pages that contain
#    certain kinds of URLs or email addresses (namely, URLs or email
#    addresses that SpamBlacklist thinks look spammy). 
#    
#    One solution is to just turn off Extension:SpamBlacklist entirely.
#    But even if you don't have that kind of administrative access,
#    you might still have enough access to *configure* the extension, 
#    in which case you can whitelist everything via a catchall regexp.
#    Visit one or of of these pages:
#
#      https://mywiki.example.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist
#      https://mywiki.example.com/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Email-whitelist
#
#    You'll see a commented-out explanation of how the whitelist works.
#    Just add a line with ".*", as in this example...
#
#      # External URLs matching this list will *not* be blocked even if they would
#      # have been blocked by blacklist entries.
#      #
#      # Syntax is as follows:
#      #   * Everything from a "#" character to the end of the line is a comment
#      #   * Every non-blank line is a regex fragment which will only match hosts inside URLs
#      .*
#
#    ...to be able to save a page with any URL (and things work
#    similarly on the Email-whitelist page).
