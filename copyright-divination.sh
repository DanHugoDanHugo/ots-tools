#
# Use this script to find out in which years a given file was modified
# enough to include in copyright notices.  The script takes a
# git-versioned file as its argument and returns a newline-separated
# list of years to include in the copyright notice on that file.
# 
# THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE.  We do not assert that
# its results are correct or that they will stand up under legal
# scrutiny.  The script may return years that are not significant from
# a copyright perspective (false positives).  We are aware of this bug
# but have not introduced heuristics to correct it.  This script is
# designed to assist humans as they determine the correct years to
# include in their copyright notices, not to replace human effort and
# intelligence.
