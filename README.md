# OTS Tools

This repository contains various scripts we wrote at [Open Tech
Strategies](https://opentechstrategies.com) to help us in our work.

Note that once a program becomes large enough, we usually move it from
here to its own repository.  That's what happened with
[csv2wiki](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/csv2wiki) for
example.
