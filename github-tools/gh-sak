__doc__ = """\
Manipulate issues associated with a GitHub repository.  Usage:

  $ ./gh-sak --root OWNER[/REPOS] [ --infile INPUT_FILE ] COMMAND

OWNER/REPOS is something like "opentechstrategies/ots-tools".

Some COMMANDs, e.g., listing all issues, require no further specification.
Others COMMANDs, such as determining different labels across a bunch
of issues, operate batch-style on an input set passed via INPUT_FILE.
INPUT_FILE is a JSON-format file whose structure depends on COMMAND.

GitHub authentication and authorization
---------------------------------------

Each time you run this script, you will be prompted for a GitHub
authorization token.  If you don't want to be prompted, put the token
as the first line of a file (you might want to restrict that file's
permissions so that only you can read it) and pass the file with the
'--auth-token-file' option, like so:

  $ ./gh-sak --auth-token-file FILE_CONTAINING_TOKEN ...

(We don't offer a way to pass the token directly via the command line
because then it could be leaked via 'ps' listings, shell history, etc.)

Available COMMANDs
------------------

* "list-repositories"  (no input file)

   List all the repositories under OWNER (i.e., use with '--root OWNER').

   This is the only command for which the /REPOSITORY component of the
   parameter to the --root option is not required (indeed, must be
   left off).

* "issues-summary-org"  OR  "pull-requests-summary-org"  (no input file)

  This lists all issues (or pull requests), both open and closed, in
  an Emacs Org Mode format, like so:

    * [[https://github.com/blah/blah/issues/3][3]]   (open): issue title
  
      body (i.e., first comment) here
  
    ** LABELS
       - some label name
       - another label name

    * [[https://github.com/blah/blah/issues/2][1]]   (open): other title
  
      other body (i.e., first comment) here
  
    * [[https://github.com/blah/blah/issues/1][1]] (closed): another title
  
      another body (i.e., first comment) here

    ** LABELS
       - some label name
       - yet a third distinct label name

* "list-labels"  (no input file)

  Print a list of all labels in the repository, one per line.

* "edit-issues"  (input file required)

  Manipulate issues in various ways.  Right now, the only manipulation
  supported is adding/removing existing labels to/from issues.  (See
  also the "edit-labels" command.)

  The top level structure of the JSON is a list.  Each element of that
  list is a dictionary.  The only required entry in each dictionary is
  "issue", whose value is an issue number (an integer), and each
  remaining entry is an action to take regarding that issue.  The two
  actions implemented so far are "add-labels" and "remove-labels",
  and the value in both cases is a list of label names (strings).
  For example:

    [
        {
            "issue":         1729,
            "add-labels":    ["REQ-1", "HARD"],
            "remove-labels": ["REQ-5", "EASY"]
	},
        ...
    ]

  Labels will be created as necessary, always with a gray background,
  but if a label already exists its current color will not be changed.

  Removing a label that doesn't exist is merely a no-op, not an error.

  List elements are processed in order from top to bottom; it's fine,
  though somewhat silly, for the same issue to appear multiple times.

* "edit-labels"  (input file required)

  Create, delete, rename, and change colors of labels.

  The JSON is a list of sublists:

    [ [ OLD_LABEL_NAME, NEW_LABEL_NAME, COLOR ] ...]

  Each sublist can be used to create a new label, delete an existing
  label, rename a label, change the color of a label, or rename and
  change color simultaneously.  This logic chart explains how:

    OLD_LABEL_NAME null:
      NEW_LABEL_NAME null:
        COLOR null:     ==>  ERROR
        COLOR "color":  ==>  ERROR
      NEW_LABEL_NAME "new_name":
        COLOR null:     ==>  create new label with default gray ("e2e2e2")
        COLOR "color":  ==>  create new label with color "color"
    OLD_LABEL_NAME "old_name"
      NEW_LABEL_NAME null:
        COLOR null:     ==>  delete old label
        COLOR "color":  ==>  give old label new color "color"
      NEW_LABEL_NAME "new_name":
        COLOR null:     ==>  rename label but preserve old color
        COLOR "color":  ==>  rename label and give it new color "color"

  The top-level list is processed in order, and each element takes
  effect as soon as it is processed.

Notes
-----

This code is not librarized yet.  To be a library, it would need at
least these changes:

   - All the errors followed by sys.exit(1) would need to become
     exceptions raised.

   - The inline print statements would need to be omitted or become
     some kind of progress callback.
